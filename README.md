# MRIT - Multi Roblox Instance Tool
A script that allows you to run multiple Instances of Roblox at the same time on your Windows PC.
Useful for botting, farming or grinding.


## This tool was made because most other tools like this are Malware and/or contain Trojans.


## Usage
- Extract the MRIT_v1.zip
- Run Handle64.exe and wait until it finishes (Needs to be run once before the script can work)
- Run MRIT.bat as **ADMINISTATOR** (Administrative permissions are needed to close the Singleton Handle of Roblox and )
- Wait a few Seconds and the Script should be working
- Every instance of Roblox should now stay open whenever you open a new one (The script checks every 10 seconds by default)
- To stop, just close the command prompt window

## FAQ
1. Q: Does the `Handle64.exe` contain maleware?
    - A: No. If you dont trust it you can also download it yourself from Microsoft [HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle). be sure to move it into the same directory as the .PS1 file

2. Q: Why does the .BAT file say `-ExecutionPolicy ByPass`?
    - A: By default, running Powershell scripts is restricted. This ByPass makes the script work without needing to change the script execution Policy.
